### Varying Text

- **| - Sequence**: iterates until the final element.
```
{"Three!"|"Two!"|"One!"|"Action!"|The set is live, everybody is busy filming.}
```
- **& - Cycle**: iterate and loop content.
```
It was {&Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday} today.
```
- **! - Once-only**: iterates until final element, then displays nothing.
```
He told me a joke. {!I laughed politely.|I smiled.|I grimaced.|I promised myself to not reanct again.}
```
- **~ - Shuffles**: randomised output.
```
I tossed the coin. {~Heads|Tails}.
```
#### Useful features for Varying Text
- **Blank elements**: `{'Wait for it...|||||I am here!'}`
- **Nested elements**: `Ann {waits patiently|{~sighs|shakes her head} and {&glances at her watch|stares exasperatedly at the ceiling|paces about the room}.}`
- **Divert statements**: `I {read the first few chapters.|passed the midpoint of the story.|hit the climax.|finished the epilogue.|finally put the book down. -> finding_next_book}`
- **Choice text variability**: `+ "[Hello {~there|General Grevious}!]`, or if starting with {, use **\** - `+ \ {&Hello there!|Hello there!|You were my brother Anakin!|You were my brother Anakin!} []`

Alternatives can be used inside loops to create the appearance of intelligent, state-tracking gameplay without particular effort.
