# Ink Quick Reference Sheet

> This document aims to be a somewhat more concise reference for writing in Ink. It should be easy to find specific Ink features within this document, with collapsible, fully functional code examples given where correct implementation is either non-obvious or non-trivial.

### Varying Text

Sometimes the same text will be shown multiple times within the same playthrough: when this happens, we can vary it and use **alternatives** to add flavor or reflect a dynamic game world.

Alternatives can be used to build loops that create the appearance of intelligent, state-tracking gameplay without particular effort.

- **| - Sequence**: iterates until the final element.
```
{"Three!"|"Two!"|"One!"|"Action!"|The set is live, everybody is busy filming.}
```
- **& - Cycle**: iterate and loop content.
```
It was {&Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday} today.
```
- **! - Once-only**: iterates until final element, then displays nothing.
```
He told me a joke. {!I laughed politely.|I smiled.|I grimaced.|I promised myself to not react again.}
```
- **~** - **Shuffles**: randomised output.
```
I tossed the coin. {~Heads|Tails}.
```

### Useful features for Alternative Text

- **Blank elements**:`{'Wait for it...|||||I am here!'}`
- **Nested elements**: `Ann {waits patiently.|{~sighs|shakes her head} and {&glances at her watch|stares exasperatedly at the ceiling|paces about the room}.}`
- **Divert statements**: `I {read the first few chapters.|passed the midpoint of the story.|hit the climax.|finished the epilogue.|finally put the book down. -> finding_next_book}`
- **Choice text variability**: `+ "[Hello {~there|General Grevious}!]`: if starting with {, use **\** to escape the brackets otherwise it will be read as a conditional.

### Conditional Alternative Text

Text that varies based on logic.

```
You pack up your things and {met_ryuji.made_friends: go to meet Ryuji at the arcade|head home}.
```
<details><summary>...</summary>
<p>

#### Conditional Alternative Text Example

```
-> school

=== school
    You make it through another day of school.
    * [Head out into the corridor] -> met_ryuji
    + You pack up your things and {met_ryuji.made_friends: go to meet Ryuji at the arcade|head home}.
    {met_ryuji.made_friends: -> arcade|->home}

=== met_ryuji
    A scruffy looking punk greets you in the corridor.

    "Hey, I'm Ryuji!"
        * [Return the greeting in a friendly manner.]

    You and Ryuji are friends now!
    * [Next day of school] -> school
